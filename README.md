# Pet-Care Analysis SQL Assigment

## Overview
This repository showcases my journey in completing SQL assignments during my Data Science Bootcamp. The assignments involved querying datasets related to pets, their owners, and the procedures these pets underwent. Each assignment focused on honing specific SQL skills and solving practical challenges.

### Key SQL Functions Learned
1. SELECT: Choose specific data from tables.
2. JOIN: Combine data from different tables.
3. GROUP BY: Group and summarize data.
4. Aggregates (AVG, SUM, COUNT): Calculate values based on grouped data.
5. Window Functions: Analyze data within specific ranges.
6. CTE with WITH Clause:Create temporary result sets for complex queries.
7. CASE Statement: Apply conditional logic to derive customized results.
8. LEAD and LAG: Access data from nearby rows for comparative analysis.
9. Subqueries: Utilize nested queries for advanced data retrieval.
10. ROUND: Adjust numerical values for precision.
